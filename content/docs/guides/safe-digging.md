### Introduction

This document outlines the mandatory procedures for safe digging and excavation to prevent damage to underground utilities and ensure worker safety.

### Before You Dig

* **Call 811 (or your local equivalent):** At least 48 hours before digging, contact the "Call Before You Dig" service to request utility locating.
* **Review Utility Markings:** Carefully examine and understand the markings left by utility locators. These markings indicate the approximate location of underground lines.
* **Obtain Permits:** Ensure all necessary excavation permits are obtained before starting any work.
* **Site Assessment:** Conduct a thorough site assessment to identify potential hazards, including overhead power lines and nearby structures.

### During Excavation

* **Hand Digging:** Within the tolerance zone (usually 18-24 inches on either side of marked utilities), hand digging or vacuum excavation is required.
* **Visual Confirmation:** Visually confirm the location of utilities before using any mechanical equipment.
* **Maintain Clearance:** Maintain a safe clearance from marked utilities.
* **Exposed Utilities:** If a utility is exposed, provide proper support and protection.
* **Emergency Response:** In case of a utility strike, immediately evacuate the area and contact emergency services and your supervisor.

### Key Considerations

* **Tolerance Zone:** Understand and adhere to the specified tolerance zone around marked utilities.
* **Weather Conditions:** Be aware of how weather conditions can affect digging safety.
* **Soil Conditions:** Consider soil type and stability.
* **Documentation:** Document all steps taken during the digging process.
