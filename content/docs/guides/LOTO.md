### Responsibilities

* **Authorized Employees:** Responsible for performing LOTO procedures.
* **Affected Employees:** Must understand the purpose and limitations of LOTO.
* **Supervisors:** Ensure proper implementation and training.

### Procedure

1.  **Preparation:** Identify all energy sources and isolating devices.
2.  **Notification:** Notify affected employees of the planned LOTO.
3.  **Shutdown:** Safely shut down the equipment according to established procedures.
4.  **Isolation:** Isolate all energy sources using appropriate devices (e.g., circuit breakers, valves).
5.  **Lockout/Tagout:** Apply locks and tags to each isolating device.
    * Locks must be uniquely keyed.
    * Tags must clearly identify the authorized employee and the reason for LOTO.
6.  **Verification:** Verify that the equipment is de-energized by attempting to start it.
7.  **Release:** Only the authorized employee who applied the LOTO can remove it.
8.  **Restoration:** After completing work, ensure all tools are removed and the area is safe before restoring energy.

### Types of Energy

* Electrical
* Mechanical
* Hydraulic
* Pneumatic
